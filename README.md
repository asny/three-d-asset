**This is an attempt to do a general crate for loading, saving and editing 3D assets. The idea is that it should be possible to use it as a base for any type of visualization or advanced editing tools, a bit like the `image` crate, just for 3D assets. Contributions are very much appreciated!**

The crate contain a set of common assets that are useful when doing graphics which can be loaded using the `io` module or constructed manually.
When in memory, the assets can be for example be

- visualised, for example using the [three-d](https://github.com/asny/three-d) crate or in a CPU ray tracer
- imported into a rust-based game engine
- edited and saved again
